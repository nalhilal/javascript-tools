This repository includes helper functions I use in my projects. Most are for specific purposes others can be more general.

### getWeekObject

This function takes a date and a semesters array. It will return the week number based on the semesters. If the week is between the semester it returns a negative week counting down from the start of the following semester.

The code in the file is tested with Quokka.js or see an example here: https://scrimba.com/scrim/cM36pLA9
